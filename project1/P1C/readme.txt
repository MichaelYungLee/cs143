Project Implementation:

My project implements all 5 input pages, with direct hyperlinks to four of them. 
	addAD.php -- allows a user to add an Actor or Director
	addM.php -- allows a user to add a Movie 
	addMAR.php -- allows a user to add a Movie/Actor Relation
	addMDR.php -- allows a user to add a Movie/Director Relation
	addReview.php -- allows a user to add a Review. Can only be accessed from a Movie webpage

My project also implements the two browsing pages, accessed via the search page.
	showA.php -- shows an Actor's information and their corresponding movies with links
	showM.php -- shows a Movie's information, its corresponding actors, the average user score, all user comments, and allows access to the addReview.php page to add user reviews

My project implements the one search page
	search.php -- allows users to make searches for Actors and Movies


I both started this project late and also do not like messing with front-end, which is why my site is visually barebones. I implemented all of the spec's required features, but didn't do anything else. My site does not do any input-checking. 

I am using one late day for Project 1C. I used one late day for Project 1B which adds up to 2 late days used for Project 1.
